## About Me
🎓 &nbsp;I recently graduated with a Master's in Data Science from the **University of Michigan** (GPA: 3.53/4.0), building on my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University (GPA: 3.53/4.0).

🚀 &nbsp;My passion lies in leveraging data to build intelligent systems and solve complex problems. I have a strong foundation in **Machine Learning**, **Large Language Models**, **Information Retrieval**, and **Data Engineering**.

💡 &nbsp;I've gained valuable hands-on experience through impactful roles, including:
  *   **Software Development Engineer Intern @ Amazon**: Engineered a distributed locking mechanism using Amazon DynamoDB for AWS Batch Scheduler, significantly improving system reliability and reducing troubleshooting time.
  *   **Data Scientist @ Genpact**: Developed customer segmentation models that led to a 30% lower churn and 25% higher average order value.
  *   **Graduate Student Instructor @ University of Michigan**: Led discussions and created lab assessments for "Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis," enhancing student comprehension by 20%.

🌱 &nbsp;I'm continuously exploring advances in **Transformers, Self-Attention Mechanisms, and scalable MLOps practices**.

✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I enjoy playing football, table tennis, and reading philosophy books.

✉️ &nbsp;Feel free to drop me an email at aryanrajeshsharma@gmail.com with a subject containing "GitHub: ..."! I'd be delighted to connect.
